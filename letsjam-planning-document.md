# LetsJam PWA Project Summary

## 1. Concept Overview

**LetsJam** is a progressive web application enabling friends to create collaborative music playlists across different streaming services, initially supporting Spotify and Apple Music.

**Tagline**: "Listen. Together."

**Primary Use Case**: Collaborative playlist creation for events and music sharing among friends.

## 2. User Roles & Permissions

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Manage playlist metadata, collaborators, and songs |
| **Editor** | Add/remove songs |
| **Viewer** | View-only access with optional song suggestion mode |

## 3. Core User Flows

### Playlist Creation
- User signs up and connects streaming accounts
- Creates playlist and customizes details
- Invites friends and assigns roles

### Adding Songs
- In-app song search
- Adding to shared playlist
- Automatic sync to Spotify
- Manual library addition for Apple Music users

## 4. Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- React for PWA implementation
- Service Workers for offline capabilities and installability
- Authentication, playlist management, and search interfaces
- Real-time collaboration features

### Backend
- Node.js/Express
- **Firebase** for database and authentication *(updated from initially proposed MongoDB)*
- Service integration layer for streaming platforms
- Real-time updates with Firebase Realtime Database

### Database Schema
- Users (authentication, linked accounts, friends)
- Playlists (metadata, permissions, collaborators)
- Songs (metadata, position, service URIs)

## 5. Design Guidelines

### Color Palette
- Primary: Modern blue (#3B82F6)
- Secondary: Vibrant accent blue (#1E40AF)
- Background: Light gray (#F9FAFB)
- Text: Dark (#1F2937)
- Accent: Highlight blue (#DBEAFE)

### Design Principles
- Clean, minimal interface
- Album art-forward visual approach
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Mobile-first with desktop enhancements

## 6. Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- Authentication
- Music service integration
- Basic playlist creation and editing
- Invite system
- Song search and add functionality
- PWA features (installability, basic offline support)

### Phase 2
- Enhanced collaboration features
- Push notifications
- Song suggestion mode
- User profiles
- Public/private playlist options
- Advanced offline capabilities

### Phase 3
- Friend system
- Song commenting
- Additional streaming services
- Advanced PWA features
- Desktop-optimized UI enhancements

## 7. Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Cross-Service Song Matching
- Mapping system between service IDs
- ISRC code utilization
- Metadata matching fallback

### Apple Music Limitations
- Clear onboarding for manual library addition
- Update notifications

### Real-time Collaboration
- Firebase Realtime Database implementation
- Network usage optimization
- Offline sync capabilities

## 8. API Considerations

### Spotify API
- Web API with OAuth 2.0
- Comprehensive playlist capabilities
- Rate limits: 1 request/sec (free tier)

### Apple Music API
- MusicKit JS integration
- Requires Apple Developer membership
- Limited playlist creation capabilities

## 9. Key Technology Decisions

- **Firebase** for backend, auth, and real-time database
- **React** for modern web application development
- **Service Workers** for PWA capabilities
- **Responsive design** using modern CSS features
- **Firebase Hosting** for deployment

## 10. PWA-Specific Features

- **Installability**: Web app manifest for add-to-home-screen
- **Offline Support**: Service workers for caching and offline access
- **Push Notifications**: For collaboration updates
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Background Sync**: For changes made while offline

## 11. Next Steps

1. Set up React PWA project structure
2. Implement responsive UI components based on wireframes
3. Develop authentication system
4. Implement Spotify API integration
5. Build core playlist management
6. Add Apple Music integration
7. Implement PWA features
8. Test with small user group
9. Refine and release MVP
